2.2.0.4
Corrected:
 - disabled recursive directory scanning for ROMs. This fixes potential deadlocks (https://github.com/Universal-Rom-Tools/Universal-XML-Scraper/issues/311)
 
2.2.0.3
Corrected :
 - Random Error making UXS crash. (Changing a part of MAIN <-> ENGINE communication system)
 - Changing color progressbar is now only green (Maybe a raison of random crash)
 - SSH finally will work (sorry for that)
 - Apostrophes in filename now works... (Thanks Marblemad)
 
Added :

2.2.0.2
Corrected :
 - Full Scrape don't neverend anymore.
 - SSH kill works now on scrape demande.
 - Date with only a 'Year' will work now (the date will be 'Year/01/01')
 - When adding Missing Rom, Name were "(Clone, Beta, Demo, ...)". It's OK now ;)
 - When you force JPG or PNG, Video stay in MP4.  

Modification :
 - New ProgressBar changing color (Green = OK, Red = Timeout or error download, Yellow = Not found)  

Added :
 - New, in case UXS Hang (it never happen ^^), when you re-launch a Scrape, it will ask you if you want to generate a gamelist.xml with the temporary file found.
 - New Shortcut was created at the first launch : 'Silent_UXS'. You can now run UXS silently ;)
 - New Visual info about Engine Use. Some check box corresponding to the Thread Number will tell you if the Engine is used or not.
 - 2 New Advanced Menu : Reset Autoconfiguration Path and Alt Autoconfiguration Path (only for Retropie, it put the Rom's Folder Path)
 - New Element Type : RomExcluded   

Exemple :

	<Element Type="RomExcluded">
		<Source_Type>Variable_Value</Source_Type>
		<Source_Value>%AutoExclude%</Source_Value>
		<AutoExcludeEXT>bin|img|iso|ccd|sub</AutoExcludeEXT>
		<AutoExcludeValue>(Track |[Bios]|(Bios)</AutoExcludeValue>
	</Element>

Mean :
	When a duplicate name file (without extension) is found:
	- it check the extension. If in list (bin|img|iso|ccd|sub) it won't scrape it
	- it check if the file contain a value ("(Track ","[Bios]","(Bios)"). If yes, it won't scrape it
