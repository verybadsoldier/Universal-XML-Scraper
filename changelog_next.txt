 - SSH works now on scrape
 - Date with only a 'Year' will work now (the date will be 'Year/01/01')
* Modification :
 - New ProgressBar changing color (Green = OK, Red = Timeout or error download, Yellow = Not found)
* Added :
 - New, in case UXS Hang (it never happen ^^), when you re-launch a Scrape, it will ask you if you want to generate a gamelist.xml with the temporary file found.
 - New Shortcut was created at the first launch : 'Silent_UXS'. You can now run UXS silently ;)
 - New Visual info about Engine Use. Some check box corresponding to the Thread Number will tell you if the Engine is used or not.

Exemple :
